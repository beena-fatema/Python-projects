Once upon a time in a <place>, there was a <adjective> <animal> named <name>. Every day, <name> loved to <verb> <adverb> in the <place>. One day, while <verb ending in -ing> near a <noun>, <name> found a <adjective> <object>. 

"Wow!" said <name>. "I can't wait to show this to my <family member>."

On the way home, <name> encountered a <adjective> <creature> that asked, "Can I have that <object>?" 

"No," said <name>, "I need to take it to my <family member>."

The <creature> looked <emotion> but understood and let <name> go. When <name> arrived home, <family member> was so <emotion> to see the <object>. They decided to use it to <verb> and lived <adverb> ever after.

The end.
